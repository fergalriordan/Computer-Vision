# Computer-Vision

Five-part assignment for Computer Vision module

Part 1. 

Classify all pixels in the image as (a) part of a white piece, (b) part of a black piece, (c) part of a ‘white’ square on the board, (d) part of a ‘black’ square on the board or (e) none of these.  Ensure that you use techniques which can be used in general (e.g. ideally the techniques would cope with changes in lighting and even changes in the appearance of the pieces and the board).  Write an analysis of the robustness of the techniques you have used and include suggestions for improving the robustness.
